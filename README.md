# SimpleYouTube Implementation

I'm currently interested in learning React and Redux. This is an implementation of YouTube page.

### Getting Started

There are two methods for getting started with this repo.

#### Start with git
In the command line, type following code. Make sure the system already has git and npm

```
> git clone https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git
> cd SimpleYouTube
> npm install
> npm start
```

#### Down load the file
Click [here](https://github.com/ChesterHu/SimpleYouTube) then download the .zip file.  Extract the contents of the zip file, then open the terminal, change to the project directory, and:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
